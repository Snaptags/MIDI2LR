Prerequisites
--------------------

On Windows, you need to get Visual Studio 2015 (the Community edition is free). 
On Mac, you need to install XCode, also free.

The file, Visual Studio text editor settings.vssettings, should be loaded into
Visual Studio to maintain the standard code formatting used in this project.

There is a utility used to manage JUCE projects called the Introjucer, which is
included when you download JUCE (http://www.juce.com/download) (you don't need
the actual JUCE source code, as this is already included in the repository).

Using this utility, you can easily add/remove files and update project properties
such as the build version, and it will automatically update the relevant
parameters for the Mac and Windows projects. The Introjucer project file
(MIDI2LR.jucer) is located in the root directory.

The project files for both will be located in Builds/ (MIDI2LR.sln for Visual
studio, and MIDI2LR.xcodeproj for XCode), once you've run Juce.

Build process
--------------------

The build process is quite simple.
On Windows, you simply need to run the project in Visual Studio.
By default it will be Debug mode for debugging. Switching to Release
will build a release version (which is preferable as it will reduce the
binary size slightly). Both of these builds will reside in Builds/Visual
 Studio 2015/Debug and Builds/Visual Studio 2015/Release

On Mac, you need to run the project in XCode. These builds should reside in Builds/MacOSX

Assembling the plugin
--------------------

Add the exe file (windows) or app directory (OSX) to a new directory named MIDI2LR.lrplugin.
Then add to MIDI2LR.lrplugin all the files in the project's /Source/LRPlugin/MIDI2LR.lrplugin
directory. That plugin can then be installed in Lightroom as usual.
